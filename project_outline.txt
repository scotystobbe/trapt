I want to start out with a simple CRUD interface. The project will be Javascript, React, and Vite. The api/db layer will be with Prisma connecting to a Neon Postgres database. The deployment will be with Vercel. Reference the files in /example_project for a currently functional app.

Some things to take into account when building out the project:

The intial data object will be a Song with the following properties
Id
Title
Artist
Album?
Playlist (references another table, each song belongs to a playlist)
Rating (will be represented by stars in the UI, so 1-5 as the values)
Sort Order
Notes
Spotify Link

There will be another data object called Playlist, which will have many songs, with the following properties:
Id
Name
Spotify Link

After the initial CRUD setup, I will want a Spotify integration to get the currently playing song and display the corresponding song from the database so I can rate it and add notes. I should also be able to browse the list of songs by playlist, or search for a song and add ratings and notes.

I would also like to populate the tables fully by using existing playlists on spotify to pull in and add the details.
