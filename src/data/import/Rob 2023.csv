#,Song,Artist,Notes,Rating
1,PUT YOU ON GAME,Russ,Solid advice,5
2,Grateful,El Michels Affair & Black Thought,I like Black Thought's flows and rhymes but his lyrics get sort of lost for me sometimes. Like each line has nothing to do with the next or the chorus or anything. Or some whole lines don't make sense. Maybe I'm just not sophisticated enough to get him. ,4
